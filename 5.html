<h1>The Difference between Epidemic and Pandemic</h1>
<p>
Epidemic is a term that is often broadly used to describe any problem that has grown out of control.<br>
An epidemic is defined as "an outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of the population.”<br>
An epidemic is an event in which a disease is actively spreading. In contrast, the term pandemic relates to geographic spread and is used to describe a disease that affects a whole country or the entire world.<br>
While casual use of epidemic may not require such nuance, it's important to know the differences between these two terms (and similar ones like outbreak and endemic) when considering public health news.<br>
In addition, from an epidemiologic standpoint, terms like these direct the public health response to better control and prevent a disease.
