<h1>The Structure and Type of Corona viruses</h1>
<p>
The coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells.
It first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its S1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its S2 subunit.
Two domains in S1 from different coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, leading to viral attachment.
The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion.
The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
