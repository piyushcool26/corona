<h1>How Can We Prepare Ourselves for the Next Pandemic?</h1>
<p>
We should always maintain hygiene and follow certain etiquittes when necessary.<br>
We should strive to increase our immunity and exercise daily to maintain good health.<br>
And countries should also create awareness among people to follow the guidlines given by WHO.<br>
And last but not the least countries should ensure that they should conduct research on bio-tech such that others are not affected.<br>
