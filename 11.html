<h1>Mutation</h1>
<p>
A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses.<br>
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly expanded to a global pandemic.<br>
However, numbers of infected cases, deaths, and mortality rates related to COVID-19 vary from country to country.<br>
Although many studies were conducted, the reasons of these differences have not been clarified. In this study, we comprehensively investigated 12,343 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients/individuals in six geographic areas and identified a total of 1234 mutations by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. <br>
Through a hierarchical clustering based on the mutant frequencies, we classified the 28 countries into three clusters showing different fatality rates of COVID-19.<br>
In correlation analyses, we identified that ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are in a strong linkage disequilibrium, showed significant positive correlations with fatality rates (r?=?0.41, P?=?0.029 and r?=?0.43, P?=?0.022, respectively). <br>
We found that BCG-vaccination status significantly associated with the fatality rates as well as number of infected cases. <br>
In BCG-vaccinated countries, the frequency of the S 614G variant had a trend of association with the higher fatality rate.<br>
We also found that the frequency of several HLA alleles, including HLA-A*11:01, were significantly associated with the fatality rates, although these factors were associated with number of infected cases and not an independent factor to affect fatality rate in each country. <br>
Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as BCG-vaccination status and a host genetic factor, HLA genotypes might affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19.<br>
