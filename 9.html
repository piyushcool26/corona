<h1>What Precautions should Covid-19 survivors take?</h1>
<p>
The doctor says that there are some things that COVID survivors should assess:<br>
* Their daily check of oxygen saturation, it should be maintained at >94% in room air.<br>
* They must watch for respiratory symptoms like persistence or worsening of cough and breathlessness.<br>
* Check for persistent rise of body temperature above 100F.<br>
* Watch out for signs of lethargy, drowsiness, and altered sensorium.<br>
* Regular monitoring of blood sugar in known diabetic patients. COVID infection (as any other infection) alters blood sugar levels of the body. Strict monitoring once in three days and regular consultation with your doctor is required.<br>
* Regular blood pressure monitoring in known hypertensive patients is required to avoid accelerated hypertension-related complications. Weekly blood pressure monitoring in case of controlled hypertension, or more frequently in case of abnormal readings, is required.<br>
* Follow up consultation with the doctor within seven days of discharge.<br>
* Blood investigations like CBC, CRP at first follow up, and subsequent follow-ups, if advised by a physician.<br>
* Repeat CT scan of chest after three months to look at the extent of lung recovery post-infection.<br>
