<h1>What is a virus?</h1>
<p>
Viruses are microscopic parasites, generally much smaller than bacteria.<br>
They lack the capacity to thrive and reproduce outside of a host body.<br>
Predominantly, viruses have a reputation for being the cause of contagion.<br>
Viruses teeter on the boundaries of what is considered life. On one hand, they contain the key elements that make up all living organisms: the nucleic acids, DNA or RNA (any given virus can only have one or the other).<br>
On the other hand, viruses lack the capacity to independently read and act upon the information contained within these nucleic acids.<br>
