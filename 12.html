<h1>Mutations of Corona</h1>
<p>
There could be many mutations in the fututre but to prevent them from happening we can do the following-<br>
We should develop vaccines for earlier variants and vaccinate people as soon as possible.<br>
Attention should be paid constantly for any difference in the symptoms and the body parts affected.<br>
To minimize the impact of these mutations strict lockdown should be imposed in regions which are affected by the new variant<br>
so as to protect other regions from getting these new variant cases.<br>
